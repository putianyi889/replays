I am a [minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) player with 0.52-8.80-36.29 as my records. This repository contains my videos and stats on [Minesweeper Arbiter](https://minesweepergame.com/download/arbiter.php) and videos on [Viennasweeper](https://minesweepergame.com/download/viennasweeper.php). Many early videos and stats before the year of 2020 are lost. I update this repo approximately twice every year.
