I am a [minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) player with 0.52-9.47-36.29 as my records. This repository contains all my videos and stats on [Minesweeper Arbiter](http://www.minesweeper.info/downloads/Arbiter.html). Many early videos and stats before the year of 2020 are lost. I update this repo approximately once every month.
