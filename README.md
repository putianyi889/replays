I am a [minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) player with 0.82-9.47-40.44 as my records. This repository contains all my videos and stats on [Minesweeper Arbiter](http://www.minesweeper.info/downloads/Arbiter.html). Many early videos and stats before the year of 2020 are lost. I update this repo approximately once every month.

I have not joined the [international minesweeper community](http://www.minesweeper.info/index.html) because the website is almost dead and also inconvenient to use.

My records on [Minesweeper GO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EvolveGames.MinesweeperGo&hl=en&gl=US) are 1.070-10.979-38.705 on FL and 0.100-11.177-43.005 on NF.
